# qb-gamz-food

qb-gamz-food is a script for FiveM QBCore, originally made for ESX by [gamziboi](https://github.com/gamziboi) (accessible [here](https://github.com/gamziboi/gamz-food)). You can view the original preview [here](https://streamable.com/ncpzc), though this script is slightly different due to a different UI resource.

From the original creator:
- "Instead of carrying around lots of food you go to a place and order food there."
- "Easy to configure. Currently there is only one spot, but it's easy to add more spots. Just check the config."

<h1>INSTALLATION GUIDE</h1>

1. Drop the qb-gamz-food folder into your [standalone] folder (or whichever other ensured folder you want to use)
